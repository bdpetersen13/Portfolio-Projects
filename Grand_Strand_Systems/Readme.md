This repository contains the final project for CS320: Software Automation & QA at SNHU. 

For this Assignment, I worked as a software engineer for Grand Strand Systems, a company that focused on developing and testing back-end systems. A client approached Grand Strand Systems for the task of developing a mobile application. For this project, I delivered the contact, task, and appointment services. Each of these services used an in-memory data structure to support storing contacts, tasks, and appointments.
