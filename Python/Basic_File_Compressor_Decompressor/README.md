Compression files are a great way to reduce the size of files. When the files need to be accessed, they can be decompressed.

This project is a generic representation of file compression and decompression application using tkinter for the application GUI, zlib library for basic compression and decompression, and base64 module for basic encoding and decoding of the data.

This project is currently a work in progress. However, the project is near completion and is currently in running condition.
