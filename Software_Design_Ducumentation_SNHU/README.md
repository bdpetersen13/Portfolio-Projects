This project showcases my ability to analyze and write software design documentation. In addition, this deliverable demonstrates my ability to effectively work through the design documentation of a software application and communicate it effectively to clients and development teams. 

For this project, I worked with our client, The Gaming Room. They wished to develop a new web-based game that runs on multiple platforms. This game will be based on their current game, Draw It or Lost It, which is currently only available on Androidâ€™s Google Play Store. In addition, the game is loosely based on Win, Lose, or Draw from the 1980s. Multiple teams attempt to guess what is about to be drawn in this game. Four rounds consist of a minute each where an image is pulled from a database. If the team cannot answer correctly, then the opposing team will have the opportunity to respond within fifteen seconds.
