 This repository contains the final project for CS305: Software Security at SNHU.

Software security is a vital process in the software development lifecycle. By ensuring software is secure it will safeguard companies from theft of any confidential information. While assessing the various vulnerabilities throughout this course, learning how to spot and suppress false positives became important. By suppressing false-positive, this allowed the focus to be completely on the actual vulnerabilities. For this project, I refactored code to incorporate HTTPS and preformed a static test of the system to test the vulnerabilities.
