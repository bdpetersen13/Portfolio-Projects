This project show cases my ability to analyze the Sprint process by writing a Sprint Retrospective and Review. This deliverable pulls together the Agile and Scrum practices learned in the SNHU CS250 course. 


For this project, I worked with the company ChadaTech, who is interested in switching their model from the Waterfall methodology to the Agile/Scrum framework. They believe the Agile framework is enhance their products and build a more cohesive corporate culture within the company. Our team in this project worked with the SNHU Travel board, who is seeking to expand their client base with new tools for their customers.
