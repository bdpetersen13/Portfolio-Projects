This project showcases my ability to analyze the Sprint process by writing a Sprint Retrospective and Review. This deliverable pulls together the Agile and Scrum practices learned in the SNHU CS250 course. 

For this project, I worked with ChadaTech, which is interested in switching its model from the Waterfall methodology to the Agile/Scrum framework. They believe the Agile framework enhances their products and builds a more cohesive corporate culture. In addition, our team in this project worked with the SNHU Travel board, which is seeking to expand its client base with new tools for its customers.
